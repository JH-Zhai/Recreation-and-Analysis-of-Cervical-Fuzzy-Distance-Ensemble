# Recreation-and-Analysis-of-Cervical-Fuzzy-Distance-Ensemble
We reproduced Inception V3 (Szegedy et al., 2015), MobileNet V2 (Sandler et al., 2018), and Inception ResNet V2 (Szegedy et al. 2016) and virefied them. 
We used our vision transformer model on the same data, and compared with the previous three models.
